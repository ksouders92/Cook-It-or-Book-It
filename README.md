# Cook-It-or-Book-It
Project #1 for UCF Coding Boot Camp

## Functionality
Our team (The Deep Coders) created a web app called Cook It or Book It
The "Cook It" choice uses the Edamam API to return recipes searched by the user
The "Book It" choice uses the Yelp API to return restaurants searched by the user

## Contributors
Syyad Khan created the split landing page where you choose whether to "Cook It" or "Book It"
Billy Harber created and styled the "Cook It" page and worked with the Edamam API with help from Syyad Khan
Jaime Salazar created and styled the "Book It" page and worked with the Yelp API
Kathleen Souders used firebase to store data from users who choose to sign up for the "Cook It or Book It" newsletter supporting World Food Bank
